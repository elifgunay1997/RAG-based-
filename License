## ✅ Next Step: Create the Project

Would you like me to:
- 📁 Generate the whole project folder structure (including code + README)?
- 🧱 Walk you through creating the repo on GitHub?
- 📤 Send you a `.zip` so you can upload it directly?

Also, we can add more NLP/LLM projects like:
- `turkish-text-classifier`
- `multilingual-sentiment-analyzer`
- `chat-with-your-cv`

Let me know which you'd like to add next!
